This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's FlatList component caused by incorrect key management.  The `FlatListBug.js` file shows the problematic code where keys are not properly assigned, leading to performance issues and unexpected behavior, especially with large datasets. The `FlatListBugSolution.js` shows the corrected code where unique keys are properly assigned, resulting in improved performance and predictable behavior.  This example highlights the importance of using unique keys in FlatList to ensure optimal performance and correct rendering behavior.
