The solution is to provide a unique `key` prop to each item in the `FlatList`.  This key should be a unique identifier for each item in the data array, preferably a stable ID from your data source (e.g., a database ID). Avoid using index as a key as that can lead to problems when items are added, removed or reordered. 

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} // Use a unique ID here
/>
```
This ensures that FlatList can efficiently identify changes and update the UI correctly.  For example, if you have a unique `id` for each item in your `data` array, use `keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}`.  This will solve the issues.  Always choose a key that will remain consistent even after updates to the data.
