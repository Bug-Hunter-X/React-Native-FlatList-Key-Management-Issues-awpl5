In React Native, when using FlatList with a large dataset, and if you're not careful with key management, you can easily encounter performance issues or unexpected behavior.  The key prop is crucial for FlatList to efficiently update and render items. If keys are not unique or are not properly assigned (e.g., using the index as the key), FlatList might not be able to identify changes correctly, leading to incorrect re-renders or rendering glitches.  For example, if you insert an item in the middle of a long list, using the index as a key may lead to incorrect updates and unexpected behavior.
